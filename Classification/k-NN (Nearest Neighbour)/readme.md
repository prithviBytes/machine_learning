# K-NN (Nearest Neighbour)

## Introduction

The k-NN algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. It's easy to implement and understand, but has a major drawback of becoming significantly slow as the size of that data in use grows.

## How does it work?

The k-NN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other. It is based on this assumption that the k-NN algorithm assigns a class to an object based on the classes of the k-nearest neighbors of that object.
