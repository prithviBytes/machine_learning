# Support Vector Machine

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds the best hyperplane to separate different classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between classes. SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces, handle non-linear data using kernel functions, and are robust to overfitting.

## Support vector selection with example

Support vectors are the data points closest to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. The goal of SVM is to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class, known as support vectors.
