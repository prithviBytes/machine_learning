# Simple linear Regression


## Equation of line
```
y = mx + c
```
where,
- y = dependent variable
- x = independent variable
- m = slope of the line
- c = y-intercept (constant)

### Explanation
- The equation of the line is used to predict the value of y for a given value of x.
- The slope of the line is the change in y for a unit change in x.
- The y-intercept is the value of y when x = 0.

### Example
- Suppose we have a dataset of the number of hours studied and the marks obtained by a student.
- We can use simple linear regression to predict the marks obtained by the student for a given number of hours studied.

### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Method

- The OLS method is used to find the best-fitting line for the given dataset.
- The best-fitting line is the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values.
