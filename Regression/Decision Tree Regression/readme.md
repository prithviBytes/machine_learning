# Decision Tree Regression


## CART (Classification and Regression Trees)

CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is a popular algorithm used in machine learning for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by recursively partitioning the input space into smaller regions, each associated with a particular class label (in classification) or a predicted value (in regression).


## Intuition

Imagine you have a task of predicting house prices based on features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. Decision tree regression can help you with this.

Here's a simplified intuition:

Starting at the Top: Picture a tree with branches. At the top of the tree, you have the entire dataset of houses. This is like the trunk of the tree.

Making Decisions: Now, imagine you start asking questions about the houses. The questions are based on features like "Is the number of bedrooms less than 3?" or "Is the square footage greater than 2000 square feet?" Each question divides the dataset into smaller groups of houses.

Dividing into Branches: Based on the answers to these questions, you create branches in the tree. For example, if you find that houses with fewer than 3 bedrooms tend to have lower prices, you might create a branch for those houses.

Repeating the Process: You keep asking questions and creating branches until you reach a point where further splitting doesn't significantly improve the accuracy of your predictions or until you reach a predefined stopping condition.

Making Predictions: At the end of each branch, you have a prediction for the house prices. This prediction is based on the average price of the houses that ended up in that branch.

Using the Tree for Prediction: When you have a new house to predict the price for, you start at the top of the tree and follow the branches, answering the questions along the way, until you reach a prediction at a leaf node.

So, decision tree regression essentially learns a series of simple if-then rules to predict the target variable (house prices in this case). It's like playing a game of 20 questions, where you narrow down the possibilities with each question until you make a prediction.
