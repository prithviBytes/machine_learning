# Random Forest Regression

Imagine you want to make predictions, like guessing how tall someone will be based on their age, weight, and maybe some other factors. Random Forest Regression helps you with this task.

Here's how it works:

The Forest: Think of a "forest" as a bunch of treesâ€”decision trees, to be exact. Each tree is like a different person trying to guess the height based on different rules.

Decision Trees: Imagine each person (or tree) has their own set of rules for guessing height. They might say things like "If the age is less than 10 and the weight is more than 50 kg, then the height is probably around 150 cm." Each person (or tree) has their own way of making guesses.

Ensemble: Now, instead of asking just one person, you ask many people (or trees) in your forest for their guesses. Each person (or tree) gives you their best guess based on their own rules.

Voting: Once you've asked all the people (or trees) in your forest, you collect their guesses. But instead of just taking one guess, you let them vote. The most common guess among all the people (or trees) becomes your final prediction.

Why It Works: The idea here is that while each person (or tree) might not be perfect at guessing, by asking a bunch of them and taking the average (or majority vote), you can often get a pretty good prediction.

Flexibility: Each tree in the forest can capture different patterns in the data. Some might focus more on age, others on weight, and so on. By combining their guesses, you get a more robust prediction that takes into account all these different factors.

So, Random Forest Regression is like asking a bunch of people (or trees) for their guesses about something, then taking the most popular guess as your final prediction. It's a powerful technique for making accurate predictions based on multiple input factors.



## Ensemble Learning

Ensemble learning is a machine learning paradigm where multiple models (often called "weak learners") are trained to solve the same problem and combined to get better results. The main hypothesis is that when weak models are correctly combined, they can outperform a single, more robust model.

Ensemble methods are meta-algorithms that combine several machine learning techniques into one predictive model in order to decrease variance (bagging), bias (boosting), or improve predictions (stacking).


# step by step intution of Random Forest Regression

1. Pick at random K data points from the Training set.
2. Build the Decision Tree associated to these K data points.
3. Choose the number Ntree of trees you want to build and repeat STEPS 1 & 2.
4. For a new data point, make each one of your Ntree trees predict the value of Y for the data point in question, and assign the new data point the average across all of the predicted Y values.
