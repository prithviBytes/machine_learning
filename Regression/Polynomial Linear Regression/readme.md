# Polynomial Regression

## Explanation

Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x).

The general mathematical equation for polynomial regression is:

y = b0 + b1x + b2x^2 + b3x^3 + ... + bnx^n + ε

Where:
- y is the dependent variable
- x is the independent variable
- b0, b1, b2, b3, ..., bn are the coefficients
- ε is the error term
