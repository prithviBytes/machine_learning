# Polynomial Regression

## Explanation

Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x).

The general mathematical equation for polynomial regression is:

y = b0 + b1x + b2x^2 + b3x^3 + ... + bnx^n + ε

Where:
- y is the dependent variable
- x is the independent variable
- b0, b1, b2, b3, ..., bn are the coefficients
- ε is the error term

## Intuition

The intuition behind polynomial regression is that sometimes, the relationship between variables isn't a straight line but instead forms a curve. By adding higher-order terms like 
�
2
x 
2
 , 
�
3
x 
3
 , and so on, you can capture more complex relationships between your variables.

For example, if your data points seem to follow a quadratic pattern (like a U shape), using a polynomial regression with 
�
2
x 
2
  can help your model better fit the data.

So, in simple terms, polynomial regression lets you fit a curve to your data, allowing for more flexibility and better capturing the underlying relationship between variables.
